Decimal support: Ensure @prisma/client and your app have decimal.js or similar set up if you plan to work with Decimal values. Prisma returns decimals as Decimal objects.

Arrays: Prisma handles Postgres arrays; confirm the client version supports array read/write for your chosen types. If not, use Json as fallback.

Triggers & functions: If you need triggers (trigger_update_timestamp, trigger_generate_folio, etc.) recreate them by applying the original SQL functions/triggers after you restore data — include them in a SQL migration script.

Indexes: I mapped the obvious indexes shown in your CREATEs. If you want additional indexes (GIN, trigram), add raw SQL migrations for them because Prisma's index DSL might not cover specialized GIN + ops classes.

Testing import: Start by importing a single small table (customers) and verify relations/UUIDs map correctly.

Timestamps: I used @db.Timestamptz for timestamp with timezone. Make sure your DATABASE_URL timezone / client settings are correct.
